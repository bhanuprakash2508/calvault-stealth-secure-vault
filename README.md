**CalVault** is a privacy-focused secure vault application disguised as a normal planner/calendar application. Unlike traditional password managers or vault systems, CalVault hides sensitive data behind a stealth-based authentication mechanism, ensuring the vault remains invisible to casual observers.

Instead of a visible login system, users access the vault by selecting a secret calendar date pattern followed by vault password verification, creating a multi-layer hidden authentication system.

This project focuses on **security, privacy, stealth authentication, encrypted storage, and secure recovery mechanisms**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Most password managers and secure storage applications are easily recognizable, making them vulnerable to unwanted attention.

CalVault solves this problem by disguising itself as a normal planner application.

To any normal user, the application appears as a regular calendar planner where events and schedules can be managed.

However, authorized users can secretly unlock the hidden vault by entering a predefined secret date pattern on the calendar, followed by vault password authentication.

This stealth-first design adds an additional privacy layer beyond traditional authentication systems.

---

## ❓ Why CalVault?

Traditional password managers and secure vault applications are easily identifiable, making them vulnerable to unwanted attention or forced access.

CalVault was designed with a stealth-first security philosophy.

Instead of exposing sensitive storage behind visible authentication systems, CalVault disguises itself as a harmless planner application.

Only users who know the secret calendar pattern can trigger hidden authentication and access encrypted vault data.

The goal of this project was to explore privacy-centric security design beyond traditional login systems.

---

## 🎯 Core Concept

Normal user sees:

```text
Planner Application
→ Add Events
→ Organize Tasks
→ Manage Schedule
```

Authorized user knows:

```text
Secret Calendar Date Pattern
→ Hidden Vault Authentication Trigger
→ Vault Password Verification
→ Secure Vault Opens
```

Even the recovery system remains hidden and can only be triggered using a secret recovery gesture.

---

### 🛡 Multi Layer Security Protection

CalVault implements multiple security layers.

#### Layer 1 — Stealth Protection

Application looks like a normal planner.

#### Layer 2 — Hidden Calendar Authentication

Vault unlock requires secret date pattern.

#### Layer 3 — Vault Password Verification

Vault password required after secret pattern.

#### Layer 4 — Encryption Protection

Passwords and uploaded files stored in encrypted form.

#### Layer 5 — Auto Session Lock

Vault automatically locks after inactivity.

#### Layer 6 — Activity Monitoring

Sensitive actions are recorded in security logs.

#### Layer 7 — Recovery Protection

Recovery requires hidden trigger + recovery key verification.

---

### ⏳ Automatic Session Lock

Vault automatically locks when:

* User remains inactive for 5 minutes
* User switches browser tab
* Session expires automatically

This prevents unauthorized access if device is left unattended.

---

### 📜 Security Activity Monitoring

All sensitive actions are recorded.

Activity log tracks:

* Password added
* Password deleted
* File uploaded
* File deleted
* Vault password changed
* Secret pattern changed
* Vault reset performed
* Recovery actions

Provides an audit trail for vault operations.

---

### ♻ Backup & Recovery System

CalVault includes built-in recovery mechanisms.

#### Recovery Key Generation

During initial setup:

```text
Password Created
↓
Secret Pattern Selected
↓
Recovery Key Generated Automatically
```

Example:

```text
CV-A8K2-91PL-X7QM-4TR9
```

---

#### Hidden Recovery Access

Recovery mode remains hidden.

Trigger:

```text
Tap planner title 5 times
↓
Recovery Mode Opens
```

Recovery flow:

```text
Hidden Recovery Trigger
↓
Enter Recovery Key
↓
Verify Recovery Key
↓
Reset Vault Password
↓
Create New Secret Pattern
↓
Access Restored
```

---

### ⚙ Settings Management

Users can securely manage vault settings.

Available options:

* Change Vault Password
* Change Secret Pattern
* Reset Entire Vault
* Delete Account

---

### ⚠ Secure Vault Reset

Vault reset requires password verification.

Process:

```text
Click Reset Vault
↓
Enter Vault Password
↓
Authentication Verification
↓
Delete All Password Data
↓
Delete All File Records
↓
Delete Encrypted Files From Storage
↓
Vault Reset Complete
```

Reset protection prevents accidental or unauthorized deletion.
